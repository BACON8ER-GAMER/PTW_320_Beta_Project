== Pre-requisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- https://github.com/git-guides/install-git[Git]
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g. https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Visual Studio Code])
- A GitHub account. If you do not have one, you can create an account at https://github.com/[GithHub.com].

== Introduction
This document outlines a Git workflow. It includes the inital setup of a project repository and the iterative process of pushing your commits and pulling from GitHub. It is designed to help you understand how to effectively use Git for version control in your technical writing projects. This is following the "Write the Docs" philosophy, which emphasizes collaboration and iterative development between writers and developers. Git is a powerful tool that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project efficiently.

== Setting Up Your Project Repository
To begin, you need to set up your project repository. To contribute to an existing project skip to "Forking a Repository". Setting up a new repository involves creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to your local machine. Follow these steps:

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Make sure to initialize it with a README file. 
//screenshot of creating a new repository
    - Select on the "New" button in the repositories section.
    - Fill in the repository name and description.
    - Choose visibility (public or private)
    - Select "Create repository"
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone    <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
4. Open the repository in your text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code).

== Forking a Repository
If you are contributing to an existing project, you may need to fork the repository first. This allows you to create your own copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original project. To fork a repository:

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.

   - Ensure you are on the main page of the repository you want to fork.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.
4. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the command:
   ``
   git clone <forked-repository-url>
   ``
5. Navigate to the cloned forked repository directory:
   ``
   cd <forked-repository-name>
   ``
6. Add the original repository as a remote to keep track of changes:
   ``
   git remote add upstream <original-repository-url>
   ``

== Making Changes and Committing

Once you have your repository set up or forked, you can start making changes. Follow these steps to make changes and commit them:

1. Open the file you want to edit in your text editor or IDE.

2. Make your changes to the file.

3. Save the file.

4. Stage the changes for commit using the command:
+
[source,shell]
----
git add <file-name>
----
+
Or to stage all changes:
+
[source,shell]
----
git add .
----

5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using the command:
+
[source,shell]
----
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
----

6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the command:

   ``
   git push origin <branch-name>
   `` 

Do this as many times as you need to while working on your project. Each time you make changes, repeat the steps of staging, committing, and pushing.

== Pulling Changes from the Original Repository

If you are working on a forked repository, it's important to keep your fork up to date with the original repository. To do this, you need to pull changes from the original repository. Follow these steps: 

1. Ensure you are in your forked repository directory.
2. Fetch the latest changes from the original repository using the command:
   ``
   git fetch upstream
   ``
3. Merge the changes into your local branch using the command:
   ``
   git merge upstream/<branch-name>
   ``
4. If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them in your text editor or IDE.
5. After resolving conflicts, stage and commit the changes as shown in the previous section.
6. Push the updated branch to your forked repository on GitHub using the command:
   ``
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ``

== Creating a Pull Request

Once you have made changes to your forked repository and pushed them, you can create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.

3. Click on the "New pull request" button.
4. Select the branch you want to merge from your forked repository.
5. Review the changes and add a descriptive title and comment for your pull request.
6. Click on the "Create pull request" button to submit your pull request.

== Conclusion
This document has provided an overview of the Git workflow, including setting up a project repository, forking a repository, making changes, committing, pulling changes, and creating a pull request. By following these steps, you can effectively use Git for version control in your technical writing projects. Remember to regularly pull changes from the original repository to keep your fork up to date and to communicate clearly in your pull requests.
